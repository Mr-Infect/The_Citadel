## �️‍♂️ MISSION BRIEFING

**The Citadel** is not just a training platform; it is a **battleground**. As AI systems integrate deeper into our critical infrastructure, the attack surface expands exponentially. This application is a purpose-built **LLM Pentesting Environment** designed to simulate real-world threats against Large Language Models.

We provide a safe, controlled ecosystem where security researchers, red teamers, and developers can master the dark arts of **Prompt Engineering**, **Model Manipulation**, and **AI Red Teaming**.

**Are you ready to exploit the ghost in the machine?**

## ⚡ CORE FEATURES

### 🎯 30 Unique Combat Scenarios
Forget generic challenges. We have engineered **30 distinct labs**, each requiring a unique exploitation methodology.
- **Practitioner Level**: Master the fundamentals of prompt injection and basic output handling.
- **Expert Level**: Bypass sophisticated filters, manipulate context, and exploit plugin chains.
- **Enterprise Level**: Execute zero-day prompt attacks, model inversion, and APT-style data exfiltration.

### 🧠 Hyper-Realistic AI Simulation
Powered by our proprietary `EnhancedAI` engine, the target LLM behaves with frightening realism.
- **Context-Aware Defenses**: The AI adapts to your conversation.
- **Dynamic Vulnerability Detection**: No simple regex matching; nuanced understanding of intent.
- **Natural Conversation Flow**: It feels like hacking a real human-like intelligence.

### 📊 Overwatch Admin Dashboard
For instructors and team leads, the **Command Center** provides total visibility.
- **Real-Time Attack Logging**: Monitor student prompt engineering techniques as they happen.
- **Detailed Analytics**: Track success rates, difficulty curves, and user progression.
- **Flag Management**: Dynamic flag rotation and validation.
